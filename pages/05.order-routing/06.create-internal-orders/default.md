title: 'Create Internal Orders'

The spiff hub offers the ability to create and submit orders directly via the hub. 

This means that these orders are seperated from your ecommerce store and will be easily distinguished in the orders page by the spiff hashtag logo in the integrations column. The external id will also read as null as there is no external id called.  See diagram below
