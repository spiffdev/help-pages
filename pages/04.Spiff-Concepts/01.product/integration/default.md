An Integration is the way you link spiff to one or many eccomerce sites. 

The flexibility spiff provides is the ability to manage multiple integrations from the one spiff partner account. 

For shopify users this is all created automatically during installation of the plugin so none of the action outlined below is required. 

When you create a new account you will notice that there is automatically an internal integration created. This is there so that you can build, test and add products before integrating with your store.
