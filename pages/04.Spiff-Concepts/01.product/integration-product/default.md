The Spiff Product customizer and visual configurator is a very powerful and flexible platform.  

Your spiff partner account can be integrated with many different sites (webistes) and can all be managed from the one partner account within spiff. 

This gives you the ability to control a group of products in coherent manner for the purposes of experience and fulfilment, whilst maintaining the marketing independance required to expose those products to as many customers as possible across a range of online stores and instore traffic. 

You will first need to [create an integration](/integrations) before you can do this. 

_Note: For shopify users this process is automatically created through the install process and integration products are automatically linked so no action is required. _

An Integration Product is a link from the spiff hub to the location (website) you want to display and market that product. 

The abililty to create an integration product is located inside the spiff product as seen below.
