Your customer has just placed their order, what happens now ? Spiff has developed one of the most sophisticated order routing systems in the market. 

We deliver order information in two ways. **Order Metadata** and **Print Ready PDF's**

### Order Metadata (Order information)
Order Metadata is all the information your user has entered given to you in an order summary. By Default, this order summary appears against the order number on the Orders page in the spiff Hub. By Default the orders page is set to show only todays orders. To show orders from the past click on the date picker in the top right of that page.

When you click on view orders you see all the order information the user entered making it easy to fulfil your orders. Especially powerful for customization workflows

For Shopify users, Spiff Order Routing can also populate the order details straight into your shopify oders page. This means all the information you need is in one spot making it more efficient to fulfil. 

### Ready to Print PDF's
The Spiff system also creates a print ready pdf built by your customers during their design experience. 
As a standard are created once the consumer orders their product. They are stored by default in the Spiff Order as shown in the above image to the left of the View order button. Clicking the pdf button will trigger a download to your local device. 

To add automation spiff can automate pdf routing to send them directly to an external location (your print device or 3rd Party Manufacturer). Pdf's are named after the order number from your ecommerce system.

For companies that use Third party fulfillers such as Fulfilio - Once a sale gets made online, there is a record that is sent through to the warehouse through our API plug-in with whichever warehouse software system that the Third-Party fulfiller uses. Metadata the organisation wants including, fonts, images and text is provided. For example, for Koko Black’s personalised gift cards we help them print a custom design template by connecting to their print server which prints out the personalised message inside their warehouse once the order has been placed. 

As part of our advanced order routing, which is suitable for enterprises that have multiple warehouses, after the customer has purchased the product, the Spiff system can rout the order to the nearest warehouse, to ensure that it goes to the closest warehouse to where is most appropriate. 

 Label Personalisation -  Generally, large commercial personalisation campaigns that are executed in-store will have a blockout label that is printed and applied over the existing label in a designated product.

 When the purchase has been submitted the print file will be sent to the organisation’s order queue which is then printed. Once printed this can then be placed on top of the existing label. This is what we do for Vegemite and Nestle. 


 

 

Order Summary  - Spiff provides the ability to receive the purchase as Metadata instead of a pdf. This Metadata is then displayed as a summary of the users purchases which the merchant can then use to fulfil the order. 

Suitable for businesses wishing to provide customisation features where the end product may simply require the merchant to configure a product from a set of sub products rather than actually print onto the product. 

This is more suitable when items are not made to order, and they already have everything in stock. 


This is not appropriate when customers are personalising products by uploading images etc. Any form of personalisation will mean that a PDF is required. See exmamples
