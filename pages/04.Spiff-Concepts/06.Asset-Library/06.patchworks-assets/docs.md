## Patchworks

Patchworks allows users to create a unique background or region from a predefined set of SVG's or PNG's. Patchworks randomly extract a unique portion of your chosen deisgn by **scaling** and** rotating** around the object to display different perpectives of the same art.

Patchworks are used in a design process that allows the customer to receive a completely unique version of a particular product. It works best where the base image is highly detailed like in the examples shown below. You can also find free patchworks supplied by Spiff in the **asset gallery** by checking the **public assets check** box. You can also upload as many patchworks as you like using the **Create New Asset** button in the top right.

To see pacthworks in action check out our exmaple on demo.spiff.com.au in the [boarshorts demo](https://demo.spiff.com.au/collections/apparel/products/boardshorts-demo) in second step named side pattern.

Popular examples of this technology in use were when diet Coke and Nutella used it to create a campaign where every bottle design was completely unique.
