### Fonts

Fonts are one of the asset types Spiff uses, they used in text steps which allows users to create personalized messages.

The Spiff editor accepts [True Type (.ttf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) fonts. They are uploaded using the **Create New Asset** button in the top right. When uploaded you will see an automatically generated preview of this font. If the preview image is broken, there may be a corruption with that font so it is best to delete it and try again. If the problem persists and you need that particular font please email Spiff Support using the live chat button on the right side of the screen.

Spiff provides the merchant with a host of public fonts that merchants can use for free in their respective workflows. If you have any fonts that are not TTF our editor will not recognize them. To fix this simply find a converter such as [Convertio](https://convertio.co/otf-ttf/) and change your file type to TTF.

### Placing your Fonts

Placing your fonts is made very simple with the use of [regions](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/regions). A region is an area that defines the location where the content in your step is placed on the panel. Simply find out the region in which you want your font to appear on the panel and then add your chosen frame(s).

### Attributes

The merchant can set a default font for a text step. In this case the merchant dictates that the consumer must use the font provided and no list options are shown to the user. The user is just presented with a text field with a (configurable) color picker.

You can also create an option with a list of font variants which will display like the image below.

Other controls the merchant can configure into the workflow are: 

1. **Text Alignment** - centred, justified, left, right
2. **Text Size** - select a required font size or range
3. **Text Color** - colors displayed are customisable
4. **Font Lists** - build an option using the font option type 
5. **Character Limits** - control your users results by setting character limits
6. **Constrain Text** - to a fixed region and re-size smaller or larger
7. **Profanity Filter** - Spiff moderation 
8. **Case Sensitivity** - set all text the user types to appear in uppercase, lowercase or titlecase
9. **Vertical Text** - this allows text to print vertically from top to bottom 
10. **Rotate Text** - rotate text to appear on any angle within a set region


Fonts are also vectors like SVGâ€™s and so can be re-sized to any size necessary size without compromising print quality.
