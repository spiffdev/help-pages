### Illustrations

Illustrations are [vector](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud/illustration/discover/vector-art.html) graphics drawn in Adobe Illustrator or programs like it. Vector artwork is built from vector graphics which are then exported into [svg's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (scaleable vector graphic). Our system uses these svg's as illustrations that can change colour and be sized to anything. The best thing about svg's is that they don't loose their quality when sized up.

The advantage of using SVG’s in our editor is that colours that exist within the SVG are easily modified using the spiff UI. The other obvious advantage is that for the purposes of print, SVG’s can be scaled to any size without loosing print quality.  

Spiff provides all new merchants with a library of illustrations that can be found in their asset gallery by checking the public assets check box. The user can store their illustrations in the spiff asset gallery.  

The illustrations are linked to merchant workflows by creating a new [option](http://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/options) and selecting illustration as the option type and then building a list of variants (illustrations) to be displayed in a step on a merchant workflow. 

The ability to set colours on the step is a configurable option

Unusable SVG's 
Not all SVG's are built equal. 
- In order for an SVG to be usable it cannot have a gradient or vignette. This is so that spiff can read the colour and therefore offer it for customization. 
- Too much detail. An SVG is a set of mathematical calculations that are represented by computer code in the file. The more detail, the more calculations and therefore the more processing power required by your conusmers device in order to render it. For examples of Vectors that are too detailed see [SVG Set up]().
