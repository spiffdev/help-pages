### Illustrations

Illustrations are [vector](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud/illustration/discover/vector-art.html) graphics drawn in Adobe Illustrator or programs like it. Once the vector is ready to be used it is then exported into [SVG's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (scaleable vector graphic).

The advantage of using SVG’s in our editor is that the colors that exist within the SVG are easily modified using our system. The other obvious advantage is that for the purposes of print, SVG’s can be scaled to any size without loosing print quality.

If you don't have any illustrations, don't worry. Spiff provides all merchants with a library of illustrations that can be found in their **asset gallery** by checking the **public assets** check box. You can also upload as many illustrations as you like  using the **Create New Asset** button in the top right.

The illustrations are linked to merchant workflows by creating a new [option](http://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/options) and selecting illustration as the option type and then building a list of variants (illustrations) to be displayed in a step on a merchant workflow. 

The ability to set colours on the step is a configurable option

Unusable SVG's 
Not all SVG's are built equal. 
- In order for an SVG to be usable it cannot have a gradient or vignette. This is so that spiff can read the colour and therefore offer it for customization. 
- Too much detail. An SVG is a set of mathematical calculations that are represented by computer code in the file. The more detail, the more calculations and therefore the more processing power required by your conusmers device in order to render it. For examples of Vectors that are too detailed see [SVG Set up]().
