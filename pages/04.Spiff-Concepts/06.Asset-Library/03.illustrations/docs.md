### Illustrations

Illustrations are [vector](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud/illustration/discover/vector-art.html) graphics drawn in Adobe Illustrator or programs like it. Once the vector is ready to be used it is then exported into [SVG's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (scaleable vector graphic).

The advantage of using SVG’s in our editor is that the colors that exist within the SVG are easily modified using our system. The other obvious advantage is that for the purposes of print, SVG’s can be scaled to any size without loosing print quality.

If you don't have any illustrations, don't worry. Spiff provides all merchants with a library of illustrations that can be found in their **asset gallery** by checking the **public assets** check box. You can also upload as many illustrations as you like  using the **Create New Asset** button in the top right.

### Creating an Illustration

When creating an illustration to have it optimized for Spiff remember to:

- Have 6 or less colors to keep it simple for the consumer
- Avoid extremely detailed vectors, they take too much processing power
- Don't use clipping masks, they will not work
- Don't use transparency, the color picker does not recogize it
- Don't use gradients or vignette, the color picker does not recogize them

Apart from these rules, everything else should work! Here are some perfect SVG exmaples.
