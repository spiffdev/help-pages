SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, SVG's are a file format that is used on spiff to create illustrations. On Spiff SVG’s are powerful tool as they allow the user to place on an object in any size whilst being being to amend all of the colors easily using an illustration step. 

To create an SVG for Spiff, we are demonstrating how this is done using Adobe Illustrator but you can use any program capable of building a vector.

Open Ai - create whatever shape/pattern/design you like

Make sure once you have your design, it is all grouped together. Make sure everything you want in the design is selected and go to Object > Group

After your object is grouped go to Window > Asset Export

With your asset export open drag your design into the exporter. Make sure the format is on SVG and press Export.

This will export the SVG to your desktop where you can now rename it and upload it to Spiff.

### Uploading to Spiff Hub
It’s very simple to upload it to the Hub. Simply go to your Assets tab in the sidebar and go to Illustrations.  

Then press the pink **CREATE ASSET** button in the top right.

This will open a window where you can select your SVG and press Open to upload it!  

And viola. It’s now ready to add to a workflow.

### Remember

For SVG's to work properly in Spiff they cannot contain:

	- Gradients
	- Clipping Masks
	- Opacities
	- Drop Shadows
	- Blurs & Other Effects

The reason these can't work is because the colour picker does not recognise them. If you want your design to contain these things, you will need to use a rasterised image instead (however rasters cannot change colour).

####Gradients

Below is an example of two SVG's. The one on the right cannot be used because of the gradient in the background. However the one on the left is fine. To remove a gradient open your SVG in Illustrator and change it to a solid colour.
