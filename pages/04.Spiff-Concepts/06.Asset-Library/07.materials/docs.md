Simulated surface repository. 

Whilst Materials are assets saved in the asset repository, they do not operate the same way in which the other assets do.

Materials are a combination of different images laid on top of each other (MAPS) that together help to simulate a textured surface. 

Once saved into your Materials repo as an asset, easily use them with an option to give your users choice over surfaces and finishes of your products.
