## Materials

Materials are used to create different kinds of surfaces on exising 3D models. For example you might have a shoe where you want a customer to choose between different kinds of leathers and have this update on the model. For example:

We use materials as the composition of the surface of an object.

### Storage are for assets that are used for simulating surfaces. 

Whilst Materials are assets saved in the asset repository, they do not operate the same way in which the other assets do.  

Materials are a combination of different images laid on top of each other (MAPS) that together help to simulate a textured surface.  
Once saved into your Materials repo as an asset, easily use them with an option to give your users choice over surfaces and finishes of your products.
