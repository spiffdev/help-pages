### Frames

Frames render an upload button to a step allowing users to add an image from their device. Frames can be any shape or size which gives users a lot of creative freedom when uploading images.

Like all other Spiff assets we provide you with public library so that you can start building workflows straight away. To see the library of frames simply make sure the **Show public assets** button is checked. Here are some of our existing frames.

#### Accepted File Formats

When a use is uploading to a frame their image needs to be a [JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG), [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) or [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).

#### Uploading Logos

Uploading logos to a frame works the same as uploading any other image except the image will need to have a transparent background. The file types that we reccomend to use are PNG's and SVG's because they support transaprency. JPG does not, applying a logo in a JPG will result in white space to fill the area outside of the logo.

Below is an example of how a Transparent PNG will place in the model. Notice that the white background in the file on the right does not show on the object. If this were a JPG the white background would show on the model as a square around the logo just like it does on the right.

#### How many Frames can I use?

When adding frames to a workflow step you can have as many as you like! As long as they all have the same aspect ratio. The reason they all need to be the same aspect ratio is because they will all be placed into the same [region](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/regions), which will stretch/squish a frame that is not the right size.

#### Placing your Frames

Placing your frames is made very simple with the use of [regions](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/regions). A region is an area that defines the location where the content in your step is placed on the panel. Simply find out the region in which you want your frame to appear on the panel and then add your chosen frame(s).

#### Creating a Frame

Frames are created as grey vectors in illustrator and are exported as SVG’s and uploaded to the Frames TAB in the asset gallery. Only SVG’s in this folder will be able to be used in the upload step. See uploading frames for more help on how to set up an SVG for spiff.

A user can either use one frame or many. If an Option is added (list of variants) to the step to display many frames, the user can choose from a range of shapes.

Note: Frames are vectors and so are sized to be in proportion to the length and width defined by the merchant as the area the frame takes up on the object. This means that a shape uploaded to assets will be distorted to fit within those parameters. 


Eg. In a region defined as a square, a rectangle will be resized into a square to fit.  In the example below you have a region on the bottle defined as almost a square 448x408.

You Can see that the uploaded frame shape is rectangular in shape
When it is placed onto the object it is resized and is no longer a rectangle.

Note that when the user uploads an image they can click on the image in the step and zoom in or zoom out and pan the image into their desired spot.
