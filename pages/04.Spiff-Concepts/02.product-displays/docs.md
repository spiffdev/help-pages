title: 'Product Displays'
---

This is the display that generally renders to the left side of the workflow and takes up between 50-75% of the screen depending on the users screen size and resolution. 

### 3D Models 
Uploaded as .glb files into the spiff asset repository. Used with any combination of products and workflows. 

**How to set the 3D model**
- Upload your 3D model to the asset respository in spiff 
- Or submit an asset request and will build it for you and upload it on your behalf. 
- Go to a product
- Click edit product
- Select the 'existing' button on the 3D models line 
- Select the relevant model in the assets list
- Add your workflow (below the save button) by typing the name of the relevant workflow
- Save

3D models should be kept under 50,000 polygons. If not, load time will blow out depending on the users connection. 

### 2D Models (Coming Soon) 
Upload a product image and design straight over the top of the image.
