## Overview 

The Spiff experience is administered from the **Spiff HUB** and delivered to the merchants consumers via the **Spiff 3D product Customizer**. 

Upon Integration with the spiff platform, you get access both apps within the spiff suite of products. 

##### Spiff 3D Product Customizer
The customisation interface for your consumers is delivered out of the box via an iframe. You can see from the below image of our [demo](https://demo.spiff.com.au) shopify site that the customizer opens as a pop-up modal on over the top of the product page.

Spiff is opaque to the merchants consumers. We do not redirect to a new page. A consumer never leaves the merchants store. 

The iframe loads when the spiff plugin is called, usually via a PERSONALIZE NOW button that is rendered on the merchants products page. 

The way in which this button is inserted into your store theme differs between ecommerce platforms. Here are the links for our platforms we have Integrated with:

Shopify Personalise Now Button Customization 
Wordpress Personalise Now Button Customisation

Outside of these two platforms a developer is required to interact with our API's for integration. In this case, the way in which spiff is called is completely customizable by the merchant. 



In simpler terms, **merchants use spiff to offer customization of their products**.

### Spiff Hub
