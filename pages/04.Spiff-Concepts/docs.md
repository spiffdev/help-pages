## Overview 

The Spiff experience is administered from the **Spiff HUB** and delivered to the merchants consumers via the **Spiff 3D product Customizer**. 

Upon Integration with the spiff platform, you get access both apps within the spiff suite of products. 

##### Spiff 3D Product Customizer
The customisation interface for your consumers is delivered out of the box via an iframe. You can see from the below image of our [demo](https://demo.spiff.com.au) shopify site that the customizer opens as a pop-up modal on over the top of the product page.

Spiff is opaque to the merchants consumers. We do not redirect to a new page. A consumer never leaves the merchants store. 

The iframe loads when the spiff plugin is called, usually via a PERSONALIZE NOW button that is rendered on the merchants products page. 

The way in which this button is inserted into your store theme differs between ecommerce platforms. Here are the links for our platforms we have Integrated with:

Shopify Personalise Now Button Customization 
Wordpress Personalise Now Button Customisation

Outside of these two platforms a developer is required to interact with our API's for integration. In this case, the way in which spiff is called is completely customizable by the merchant. 



In simpler terms, **merchants use spiff to offer customization of their products**.

### Spiff Hub
Merchants configure design experiences through the **SPIFF HUB**. Access to the spiff hub is provided upon [installation](#installation) of the plugin onto your ecommerce store.

- Link to existing [products](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/products) in their store that they want to offer customization on

### Consumer side 







Merchant exectution and management 
SPiff HUB - 


Merchants will find spiff in the Shopify app store via one of the many Sales Channels that funnel through to the Spiff Plugin


Whilst we use many different Sales Channels, the overwhelming majority of opportunities come from direct traffic through the Shopify app store. 


 

They find us by mainly using the following search terms: 

Product Customizer

Product Customization

3d

3d products

AR

Augmented Reality 

Anyone can find the Spiff Plugin however you must have an active Shopify Store in order to install spiff. If you find spiff whilst logged into your store, the install will begin automatically. If the merchant is not logged in, they will be prompted by Shopify to either login or sign up to create a store 


When the user is logged in they will be presented with the standard pre-install page from Shopify which makes the merchant aware that they are about to install spiff. It also notifies the user of personal details and store access that spiff requires to run. 


 


The Spiff Onboarding Experience
The primary goal of this process is to have the merchant: 

Select products they are interested in offering for Personalisation/Customisation

Create a workflow - Steps they want to offer the user. This is the customer journey

Order content they require to execute this experience or link to existing public assets

Install the Spiff Snippet  in their Liquid Templates or book a spiff consult so we can have spiff internally complete the install. To do this spiff must request access to the store  

Choose a Plan 

Display a 3D product using the plugin in their store

 


Current spiff experience 
First Page - Select Products 


Currently, only one product can be selected at a time. 

Select the product of choice and you will see the next button change from grey to spiff pink. 

On the left is a task bar that walks the merchant through their onboarding progress. There is a Help me and Skip to Consult button at the bottom of this task bar.
