Used to give your consumer a choice over the colors of your product or a portion (region) of your product.  

#### Examples:

- Material Color - What Color is the material color of your chair? 
- Laces Color - Choose the color of the laces on your shoes ? 

#### How to Create
- Click on Add color within a workflow. 
- Add your Title (E.g. Laces)
- Add your Help Text (Choose the color of the laces of your shoes)
- Add your option by either selecting a pre-made option or create a new one by clicking add variant (Red, Green, Blue, Pink Etc). Hex colours can be added. 
- Save Step

This step could be part of the standard workflow available to all or it could be linked as a conditional step by clicking the conditional button at the bottom of the step setting it to only appear when a particular variant in a previous step is selected. 

#### Customization or Personalization ?
The color step can be used as either. For choosing stocked material colors it is a customization, when choosing the color of a background to a greeting card it is a personalization as the color will need to be printed.
