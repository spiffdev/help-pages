### For Example

The [shirt configurator](https://demo.spiff.com.au/collections/demo-products/products/custom-shirt-configurator) product on our demo store uses the model step to change what kind of collar, cuffs and placket a shirt has.

You can use this step to customize any kind of model you like.
