### Adding Text Step

This step type allows you to set defined areas ([regions](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/regions)) on your product that you would like them to be able to personalize. One of the most common step types used on the Spiff platform, **Add Text** allows you set a number of configurations which give you the ability to completely control the experience you have always wanted to deliver.
