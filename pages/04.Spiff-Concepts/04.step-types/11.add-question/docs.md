## Question Step

Question steps are used when you need to ask your customers a question.

### Ask a Question

_Used to give your consumer a choice that does not affect the product display._

Examples: 
- **Sizes** - Choice of shirt, jeans, shorts, shoes, etc.
- **Upselling** - Would you like the product gift wrapped? 
- **Reference for Conditional Step** - Would you like to include extra images and text on the back?

#### How to Create
- Click on Add step within a workflow. 
- Add your Title (E.g. Extra: Add personalisation to sleeve)
- Add your Help Text (You have personalised the front of your shirt, personalise the sleeve for only $5 extra)
- Add your option by either selecting a pre-made option or create a new one by clicking add variant (YES,NO)
- Save Step

Then you create your text step allowing the user to add a message to the sleeve and set a condition to make it only appear if the consumer selects yes to the above question step. 

#### Customization or Personalization ?
Whilst the question step is a customization, when used as condtional pre-cursor, it can lead to personalization steps.
