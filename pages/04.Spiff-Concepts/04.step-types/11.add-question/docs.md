#### Ask your customers a question
Used to give your consumer a choice that does not affect the product display.  
Examples: 
- Sizes - shirt, jeans, shorts, shoes etc 
- Upselling - Would you like the product gift wrapped? 
- Reference for Conditional Step - Would you like to include extra images and text on the back ? 

#### How to Create
- Click on Add step within a workflow. 
- Add your Title (E.g. Extra: Add personalisation to sleeve)
- Add your Help Text (You have personalised the front of your shirt, personalise the sleeve for only $5 extra)
- Add your option by either selecting a pre-made option or create a new one by clicking add variant (YES,NO)
- Save Step

Then you create your text step allowing the user to add a message to the sleeve and set a condition to make it only appear if the consumer selects yes to the above question step. 

#### Customization or Personalization ?
Whilst the question step is a customization, when used as condtional pre-cursor, it can lead to personalization steps.
