## Patchworks

Patchworks allows users to create a unique background or region from a predefined set of SVG's or PNG's. Patchworks randomly extract a unique portion of your chosen deisgn by scaling and rotating around the object to display different perpectives of the same art.

### Unique Art

Do you have a detailed graphic or a large mosaic picture? If so, using patchworks you can give every person a unique portion of that image to set in your product. Most popular examples have been Mosaic Diet Coke or Mosaic Nutella. Check your assets repository, we give a few examples to use for free!

_Complexity = Advanced (only in that you need a highly detailed image for this step to be effective)_

_Important note: Spiff provides you with examples that you can use in your workflow. Simply go to options and create a patchwork option and link the variants in the patchworks folder._

This step could be part of the standard workflow available to all or it could be linked as a conditional step by clicking the conditional button at the bottom of the step setting it to only appear when a particular variant in a previous step is selected. 

#### Customization or Personalization ?
The Material step is a personalization. A customer selection will be unique and must be printed and applied to the product.
