## Picture Step

Images are raster based PNG's or JPG's/JPEG's that you can curate for use in workflows. The difference between images and illustrations is that images are raster based, meaning you cannot change the color of them and they loose quality if you enlarge them. On the other hand illustrations are vector based and can change color and be resized to anything.



The picture step allows users to choose from a preselected list of JPEG and PNG images to add to their design.
