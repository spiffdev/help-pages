## Workflow Details

This is the area when you can adjust global settings to your workflow. Keep in mind that these settings are for the entire workflow and not a specific step.

### Global Settings
 
There are three global settings in your workflow details. These are:

1. **Advanced Editor Enabled Mode** - Great for use when setting up your workflow to test what your pdf will look like without placing an order.

3. **2D Preview Download** - Enabled this will render a button allowing the user to download a non print ready png of the 2D design before checking out
