When you set up your panel(s) remeber to add at least 2mm [bleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_(printing)) so that the edges of your design don't get cut off.

- To have content rendered in a step appear on a 3D model.

### Naming your Panel:
It is important to note that for the purposes of the output file (pdf), you can name your panel anything. But to have the panel appear on a 3D model, you must match the panel name exactly (case sensitive) to the material name of portion of the 3D model you would like your panel to appear on.
