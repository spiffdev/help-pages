### What are Panels? 

A panel is the base canvas that wraps onto your model. Panels are used to create pdf's.

When you set up your panel(s) remeber to add at least 2mm [bleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_(printing)) so that the edges of your design don't get cut off.

  ### Panel Measurements 

Panels are measured in **points** or **pixels** by a **width** and a **height**. So if your design is in millimeters or any other measurement you will need to convert it to points/pixels. You can do this easily using google or programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

### How many Panels can I have?

You can have as many panels as you like. You just need to be able to match the panel sizes and names to what is on your 3D model. To find out what the names are on your model go to [Babylon Sandbox](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) and drag your model into the browser. In the bottom right corner there are 3 icons, select the first one that is highlighted red in the example below.

### A Panel is Needed:
- To have content rendered appear in place on the output file used to fulfil the personalized item (pdf).
- To have content rendered in a step appear on a 3D model.

### Naming your Panel:
It is important to note that for the purposes of the output file (pdf), you can name your panel anything. But to have the panel appear on a 3D model, you must match the panel name exactly (case sensitive) to the material name of portion of the 3D model you would like your panel to appear on.
