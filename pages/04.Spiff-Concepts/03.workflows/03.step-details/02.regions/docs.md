### What is a Region?

A region is an area that defines the location where the content in your step should be placed on the panel.

A region can be any kind of rectangular shape.


### Defined in points, it is:
1. the distance from the left edge of the panel (x) 
2. the distance from the top edge of the panel (y)
3. the width of the area you are allowing your content to be sized into (w)
4. the height of the area you are allowing your content to be sized into (h) 

These are the values you would see allocated to an object (e.g. text box) in illustrator or photoshop or any other design program. 

To set the region you will need to refer to the information you have in your orginal design file. 

In the region, we also set a layer index which refers to the layer order a step will appear in. This is important as it determines what order design steps are rendered on the canvas regardless of the step order. 
We also set a rotation from 0° to 360°
