### What is a Region?

A region is an area that defines the location where the content in your step is placed on the panel.

A region can be **any rectangular shape**, and sit anywhere on the panel.
You can also have multiple regions per step. To add more regions simply use the **+ ADD REGION** button and enter in your measurements.

### Placing your Regions

Regions are defined in pixels, so to find out where to place them make sure your design file is in this measurement.

To find out what your coordinates are find the:

1.  **(x)** Distance from the left edge of the panel  
2. **(y)**  Distance from the top edge of the panel
3. **(w)** Width of the area your content will be to be sized to
4. **(h)**  Height of the area your content will be to be sized to

These are the values you would see allocated to an object (e.g. text box) in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop or any other design program.
Regions are measured from the top left corner of your panel so whatever 

It Illustrator your regions would look something like this -

In the region, we also set a layer index which refers to the layer order a step will appear in. This is important as it determines what order design steps are rendered on the canvas regardless of the step order. 
We also set a rotation from 0° to 360°
