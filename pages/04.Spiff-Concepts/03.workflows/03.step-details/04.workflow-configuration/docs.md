## Preview Configuration

Preview configuration is the area where you set the details of your 3D model. You can adjust the zoom, angle of rotation, rotation, etc. Setting these up can be confusing so if you need help please book a zoom meeting on https://calendly.com/spiffhelp and will go through it with you.

- **Zoom In** - This controls how far you can zoom into a model. For example on a model that has text you may want the user to be able zoom right in to read the text. Or for a larger model you might want to stop them from zooming so they can always see the whole model. To zoom in hard try adding **0.001**.

- **Zoom Out** - This works the same as zooming in.

- **Minimum Vertical Rotation** - A value, in degrees, representing the lowest angle the camera can view your product from. If blank, there is no limit.
