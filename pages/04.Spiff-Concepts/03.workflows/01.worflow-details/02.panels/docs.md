### The canvas to your masterpiece! 

The Canvas your design is built over that forms the base size of your pdf. Be sure to include bleed in this calculation. 

Defined in **Points** or **pixels** by a **width** and a **height**. 

### For example:
A4 in mm = 210 (w) x 297 (h)  in points =  595 (w) x 841 (h)
A4 withbleed in mm = 216 (w) x 303 (h) in points =  612 (w) x 859 (h)

|Size|Width (mm)|Height (mm)|Width (points)|Height (points)|
| ------ | --- | ---- | ----|
|A4|210|297|595|841|
|A4 with bleed|216|303|612|859|


### A panel is needed:

- To have content rendered in a step appear on a 3D model 

### Naming your Panel
It is important to note that for the purposes of the output file (pdf),  you can name your panel anything,  but to have the panel appear on a 3D model, you must match the panel name exactly (case sensitive) to the material name of portion of the 3D model you would like your panel to appear on.
