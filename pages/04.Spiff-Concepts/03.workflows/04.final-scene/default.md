## Final Scene

The final scene is where you set the configeration to control what shows on the final scene of each workflow.

#### Finalize Step

In this section you choose if you would like a **Confirm Design Display** page or not. This just means if there is a check box on the final page that users need to click to agree that they are happy with their design. The other option here controls if you want a **2D Preview** or not.

#### Camera Animation

This is where you set you camera animation. Read more [here](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/step-animation).

#### Model Animation

This is where you can set an animation to play on your step. For example you could have a jar and you could make the lid come off and sit next to it. You could do this by enterting 1 - 10 for example. The loop button makes the animation play on repeat.

See an exmaple [here](https://demo.spiff.com.au/collections/demo-products/products/the-egg).
