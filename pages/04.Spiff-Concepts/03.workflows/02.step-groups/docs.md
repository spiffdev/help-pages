## Step Groups

Steps can either be displayed **individually** or in **groups**. Keeping a step by itself is a good way to keep consumers focused on one step at a time. This can be important to not overload the user with information. However if the step relates directly to another step it can be a clean way to show this to the user my putting them in a group together.

When adding steps groups also be aware of how it will show on **mobile** and **desktop*.

This is what an workflow looks like that has three steps put into a group.

**Examples**
1. Customising a tshirt - everything in a particular view of the 3Dmodel should be listed in a step group ie the front panel of the shirt (base colour, illustration, image upload etc)  

2. Tote bag - group 1 could be the material and base colour (non printed customisations) and group could be the logo upload and typed message (printed components)  

3. Custom shoe - group customisations in to one step group and upsell items into another group (care products)

1. Click add step group when you open a workflow. (Note: you need at least 2 steps to create a step group) 
2. Name your step group - this name will appear in the top Nav Bar above the Workflow for the consumer
