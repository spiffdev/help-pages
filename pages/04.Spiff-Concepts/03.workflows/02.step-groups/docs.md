## Step Groups

Steps can either be displayed **individually** or in **groups**. Keeping a step by itself is a good way to keep consumers focused on one step at a time. This can be important to not overload the user with information. However if the step relates directly to another step it can be a clean way to show this to the user my putting them in a group together.

When adding steps groups also be aware of how it will show on **mobile** and **desktop**.

This is what an workflow looks like that has three steps put into a group on desktop. Notice how in the corner it's 1/2 steps.

This is what it's like then the steps are seperate. Notice how in the corner it's our of 4 steps.

It doesn't matter if your steps are in a group or not they will still do the exact same thing. The only change it makes is how they are displayed.

### Adding Step Groups

It's very easy to add a step group. Simply press the **Add Step Group** button and then name your step group. You can name it anything you like.

Once you have created and named your Step Group, go into the step you'd like to add it too using the downwards arrow and scroll till you see the **Step Group** section. Click the arrow and select your chosen step group. Save workflow.

_Note: You need at least 2 steps to create a step group._
