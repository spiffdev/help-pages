### Display steps in a group on the same page
Steps can either be displayed individually to keep a consumer focused on one very important decision or grouped together on the same page to provide the consumer with context over a section in your design template.  

**Examples**
1. Customising a tshirt - everything in a particular view of the 3Dmodel should be listed in a step group ie the front panel of the shirt (base colour, illustration, image upload etc)  
2. Tote bag - group 1 could be the material and base colour (non printed customisations) and group could be the logo upload and typed message (printed components)  
3. Custom shoe - group customisations in to one step group and upsell items into another group (care products)  


**How to use**
1. Click add step group when you open a workflow. (Note: you need at least 2 steps to create a step group) 
2. Name your step group - this name will appear in the top Nav Bar above the Workflow for the consumer
3. Click on a steps and allocate to your named step group with the dropdown below the help text 
4. Save workflow
