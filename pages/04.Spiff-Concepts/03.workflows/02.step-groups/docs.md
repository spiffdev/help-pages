title: 'Step Groups'

### Display steps in a group on the same page
Steps can either be displayed individually to keep a consumer focused on one very important decision or grouped together on the same page to provide the consumer with context over a section in your design template.  
#### Example:
- customising a tshirt - everything in a particular view of the 3Dmodel should be listed in a step group ie the front panel of the shirt (base colour, illustration, image upload etc)
- tote bag - step group 1 could be the material and base colour (non printed customisations) and step group 2 could be the logo upload and typed message (printed components)
