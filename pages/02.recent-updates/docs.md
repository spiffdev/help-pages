Spiff Begins documentating updates and improvements

### Text Attributes

Spiff contniues is journey towards allowing merchants full control over their workflows. Within the Add Text step in a workflow you can now:

- Max Length - Set Maximum number of characters in a text field
- Default Text Color - Set the default text colour when the consumer loads the workflow
- Enable Color Picker - This allows the consumer to change the color of the text field in the workflow
- Enforce Uppercase - Forces any text typed by the consumer to be UPPERCASE
- Vertical Text - Text appears top to bottom instead of left to right
- Text Justification - Centre, Left and Right
