title: 'Introduction to Spiff'
---

Spiff is a cloud based business tool used by retailers and eccommerce merchants to drive incremental sales through the delivery and managment of an inline personalized or customized experience.  Spiff delivers automation and interaction in all aspects of the user journey from user orders right through to fulfilment. 

In simpler terms, merchants use spiff to offer customization of their products. 

_Spiff Mantra - simulating the instore experience _

Spiff Hub
Merchants configure design experiences through the **SPIFF HUB**. Access to the spiff is provided upon [installation](#installation) of the plugin onto your ecommerce store. 













### Consumer side 

##### Spiff 3D Product Customizer
A plugin to a merchants online store. Our experience out of the box is delivered via an iframe. Spiff is opaque to the merchants consumers. We do not redirect to a new page. A consumer never leaves the merchants store. 

The iframe loads when the spiff plugin is called, usually via a PERSONALIZE NOW button that is rendered on the merchants products page.

Merchants will find spiff in the Shopify app store via one of the many Sales Channels that funnel through to the Spiff Plugin


Whilst we use many different Sales Channels, the overwhelming majority of opportunities come from direct traffic through the Shopify app store. 


 

They find us by mainly using the following search terms:

Anyone can find the Spiff Plugin however you must have an active Shopify Store in order to install spiff. If you find spiff whilst logged into your store, the install will begin automatically. If the merchant is not logged in, they will be prompted by Shopify to either login or sign up to create a store 


When the user is logged in they will be presented with the standard pre-install page from Shopify which makes the merchant aware that they are about to install spiff. It also notifies the user of personal details and store access that spiff requires to run. 


 


The Spiff Onboarding Experience
The primary goal of this process is to have the merchant: 

Select products they are interested in offering for Personalisation/Customisation

Create a workflow - Steps they want to offer the user. This is the customer journey

Order content they require to execute this experience or link to existing public assets

Install the Spiff Snippet  in their Liquid Templates or book a spiff consult so we can have spiff internally complete the install. To do this spiff must request access to the store
