### Integration with a non Shopify or Wordpress Website ( Or if you want bespoke behaviour)    
This page describes for developers, how you can use our Javascript API to use the spiff services with an ecommerce platform.  

Before you integrate you will need to sign up to a free account on spiff and then create a partner account. After this, you will be asked to create an integration which will provide you with a API Key and Secret.   

Then use the following pages to complete your integration  

1. [Integrations](/integrations)  
2. [Spiff Javascript API](/javascript-api)
