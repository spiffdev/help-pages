Install the app. 
No credit cards required upfront. Free trial period of 14 days applies so installing is risk free. 

The merchant must have an active Shopify Store in order to install spiff. If you install spiff whilst logged into your store, the install will begin automatically. If the merchant is not logged in, they will be prompted by Shopify to either login or sign up to create a store

Next, you are presented with the standard pre-install page from Shopify which makes you aware that you are about to install spiff. It also notifies you of personal details and store access that required.

Install the snippet and render the button
via a Install the Spiff Snippet in their Liquid Templates or book a spiff consult so we can have spiff internally complete the install. To do this spiff must request access to the store  



>>> the way that spiff opens in your site is customisable but would require a developer with shopify liquid templates experience to interact with our api 

#### Personalise Now Button
The Personalise now button renders on the product page and is customisable via the [install snippet](http://help.spiff.com.au/#installation) that is inserted into your store. It is rendered whereever your theme renders the 'Add to Cart' button

Customizable Attributtes of the Personalize Now Button (Edited in your Liquid Templates)

- Position
- Button Color
- Button Text
- Choose to appear with or instead of the Add to Cart button.

Here is an example
