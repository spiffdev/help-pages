On the #SPIFF editor, our 3D assets must be uploaded in the '.GLB' 3d model file format, this is explained in further detail in the [Model Conversion](https://help.spiff.com.au/setting-up-3d-models-for-spiff/converting-a-3d-model-to-glb ) page.

**There are 3 essential steps to follow to set up your 3d model to work with your product and workflow. We must:**

1.Import your 3d model file(s), like an **.fbx** or **.obj** file to a 3D modelling program or 'toolset' (Like **"Blender"**, which we use primarily and what we reference heavily in our documentation)

2.Create or adjust pre-existing materials (referred to as panels) to work in the GLB format.

3.UV unwrap our model or section of model in a way that makes sense contextually (a label on a bottle will be UV unwrapped to a label image file, for example)
