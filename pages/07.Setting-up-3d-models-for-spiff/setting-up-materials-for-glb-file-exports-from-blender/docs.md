The **.glb/.gltf** model format supports full [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering)(Physically-Based-Rendering) material support when used correctly. In this page we explain the setup for these materials using the standard [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3d software.

## Finding your Materials
Continuing from the [.GLB Conversion](https://help.spiff.com.au/setting-up-3d-models-for-spiff/converting-a-3d-model-to-glb ) document, we can navigate to our blend file that we saved earlier, or alternatively re-import your model file to a fresh blender file. 

Within blender, we can select the objects that we want to create, or otherwise adjust materials on. In this case we will select the object we want to inspect (Left Click it), and then navigate to the materials sections of the properties tab. (See attached) Make sure you are in ‘Object Mode’ while doing this. Or, if in edit mode, you can select specific mesh of the object and assign a material to that section. You can switch between these nodes with **CTRL+TAB.**
