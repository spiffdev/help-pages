### User image Uploads  
Set an area (region) on your product to allow the user to upload their image. You Set the area the user uploads by selecting a frame from your assets folder. A frame is an SVG that is coloured grey (for aesthetics) that we use to identify the area an uploaded image will fill.   

This can therefore be anyshape you please, Even broken up as the examples below show

Users can zoom in and out as well as re-position to set the image in the exact spot. 
This is then cropped into the pdf and supplied to you the merchant upon order so no set up is required.
