#### Customers can materials, textures and product finishes  
Give customers choice over materials or textures you have avialable and let them see an accurate represantion of this on the 3D model. 

Complexity = Advanced

#### Examples: 
- Material - Select from the following material finishes for your ToteBag (Cotton, Velvet, Snakeskin, etc)?
- Finish - What finish are you after (Gloss, Matt, Satin)? 
- Texture - What type of legs do you want for your table (Wood, Metal, Synthetic etc)? 

#### How to Create
- Click on Add Material Step within a workflow. 
- Add your Title (E.g. Tote Bag Material)
- Add your Help Text (E.g. Choose the Material you would like for your Bag)
- Add your option by either selecting a pre-made option or create a new one by clicking add variant (Velvet, Cotton, Snakeskin).
- Save Step

_Important note: In the option you create for a material you need to set a texture file for each variant. A texture file (normal map) is a PNG image which is blueish purple in colour. It is an RGB representation of the texture which we can use to simulate a material or finish. More on Normal Maps._

This step could be part of the standard workflow available to all or it could be linked as a conditional step by clicking the conditional button at the bottom of the step setting it to only appear when a particular variant in a previous step is selected. 

#### Customization or Personalization ?
The Material step is a customization. A customer chooses a texture and the merchant would usually pick, configure and pack item for consumer. No printing is required for this step.
