Fonts are used in the Add Text Step Type in workflows which allows the merchant to set 1 or more regions on a canvas where the user can type in a personalized message. 

The spiff editor accepts True Type (.ttf) fonts. They are uploaded to the spiff platform via the spiff hub in the assets folder. Spiff provides the merchant with a host of public fonts that merchants can use for free in their respective workflows. 

Click on the assets folder and select the fonts tab
Then click the create asset button and upload your fonts

They will then appear as they do in the image above. You will see an automatically generated preview of this font. If the preview image is broken, there may be a corruption with that font so it is best to delete it and try again. If the problem persists and you need that particular font please email spiff support using the live chat button on the right side of the screen.   

#### Attributes
The merchant can set a default font for a text step. In this case the merchant dictates that the consumer must use the font provided and no list options are shown to the user. The user is just presented with a Text field with a (configurable) color picker. This is displayed in the left hand imnage below

You can also create an option with a list of font variants which will display like the right hand above image. 


Other controls the merchant can configure into the workflow are: 

- Text alignment - centred, justified, left, right
- Text Size - Select a required font size or range
- Text Colour - colours displayed are customisable
- Font Lists - build an option using the font option type 
- Character Limits - Control your users results by setting character limits if the design you provide requires it. 
- Constrain text to a fixed region and re-size smaller or larger depending on character length
- Profanity filter - Spiff Moderation 
- Case sensitivity - Set all text the user types to appear in Uppercase, Lowercase or Titlecase
- Vertical text - This allows text to print vertically from top to bottom 
- Rotate text - Rotate 

Fonts are also vectors like SVGâ€™s and so can be re-sized to any size necessary size without compromising print quality.
