Spiff provides its Merchants with a Digital Asset Mangement Repository. This repository is used to store all assets required to execute a personalization  
or customization workflow for the merchants customers. 

Assets types available for storage on spiff are: 
- [Fonts](#fonts)
- [Frames](#frames)
- [Illustrations](#illustrations)
- [Images](#images)
- [3D Models](#3d-models)
- [Patchworks](#patchworks)  

Assets are located in the spiff hub from within your ecommerce store. Click on the assets button in the left hand Navigation bar and you be presented with the Repository. The default page is the fonts page.

>>>> You must click on the relevant Asset type before you click the create asset button. The create asset button will only allow you to upload file types of the relevant asset type.

### Illustrations

Illustrations are vector art usually drawn in illustrator or a program like it. The spiff editor accepts illustrations in the form of SVG (scaleable vector graphic).

Example SVGS
<p float="left">
  <img src="[](ladybug.svg)" width="100" />
  <img src="[](bee%201.svg)" width="100" /> 
  <img src="[](dragon%20fly.svg)" width="100" />
</p>

The advantage of using SVG’s in our editor is that colours that exist within the SVG are easily modified using the spiff UI. The other obvious advantage is that for the purposes of print, SVG’s can be scaled to any size without loosing print quality.

Spiff provides all new merchants with a library of illustrations that can be found in their asset gallery by checking the public assets check box. The user can store their illustrations in the spiff asset gallery.

The illustrations are linked to merchant workflows by creating a new [option](http://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-20concepts/options) and selecting illustration as the option type and then building a list of variants (illustrations) to be displayed in a step on a merchant workflow.
