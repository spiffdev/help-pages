### User Image Uploads 

Set an area (region) on your product to allow the user to upload their image. You set the area the user uploads by selecting a [frame](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/asset-library/frames) from your assets folder. A frame is an SVG that is coloured grey (for aesthetics) that we use to identify the area an uploaded image will fill. If you want your upload area to be a square or rectangle you don't need to use a frame, simply set your desired [regions](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/regions).

This can be any shape you please, even broken up into pieces. Users can zoom in and out as well as re-position to set the image in the exact spot. 
This is then cropped into the pdf and supplied to you the merchant upon order so no set up is required.
