## Color Step

Color steps are used to give your consumer a choice over the colors of your product or a portion (region) of your product.

### How to Create

1. Click on **Add Color** within a workflow
2. Add your title (E.g. laces)
3. Add your **Help Text** (choose the color of the laces of your shoes)
4. Add your option by either selecting a pre-made option or create a new one by clicking add variant (red, green, Bblue, pink, etc). Hex colors can be added. 
5. Save step

_This step could be part of the standard workflow available to all or it could be linked as a conditional step by clicking the conditional button at the bottom of the step setting it to only appear when a particular variant in a previous step is selected._

### Customization or Personalization?

The color step can be used as either. For choosing stocked material colors it is a customization, when choosing the color of a background to a greeting card it is a personalization as the color will need to be printed.
