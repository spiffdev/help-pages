#### Upsell your customers within the desgin experience

Set pricing against assets/variants within an option. A powerful feature that allows you to set different pricing depending on almost any variable. 

How to use 
- In the options section 
- Click on an option or create a new option
- Choose the option type
- Add a variant/asset
- Set a price to it (our system uses the default currency in your store) 
- Save

If you wanted to set pricing to a process rather than an asset/variant simply create a question step with all the options for each process set as a variant/asset. Then set a condtional steps on each of the different processes (steps) to only trigger when that option is selected. A price can be set in the question step against that process in the variant/asset.
