## Install Setup Instructions
For Neto customers, components of the setup will need to be created by the spiff3D integrations team.

## Installation Process
The merchant will install the spiff plugin app from the Neto add-on store which will redirect them to a page asking them to sign into their store account for verification. **Image reference below.**

Once the user enters their details they will then be redirected to the Spiff hub front page with a new integration and partner. **Image reference below.**
