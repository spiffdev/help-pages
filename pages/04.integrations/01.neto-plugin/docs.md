## Install Setup Instructions
For Neto customers, components of the setup will need to be created by the spiff3D integrations team.

## Installation Process
The merchant will install the spiff plugin app from the Neto add-on store which will redirect them to a page asking them to sign into their store account for verification. **Image reference below.**

Once the user enters their details they will then be redirected to the Spiff hub front page with a new integration and partner. **Image reference below.**

You can now explore the hub as you wish! To edit your account details simply head to **Partner â†’ My Account** and you will be greeted with an array of options. **Image reference below.**

### Setting Up The Webhook
To make sure your Neto store is connected to the Spiff webhook you need to navigate back to your Neto store. Once in the store on your left side panel navigate to **All Settings & Tools**. **Image reference below.**

You will be greeted with a search bar where you will enter **API Settings**. Click on it and that will redirect you to a page where we can enable the webhook and enter a custom url that will notify Spiff when an order has been placed. **Image reference below.**

You then need to toggle the **Enable Neto API Webhook** option and you then need to add in the custom webhook url into the **Neto API webhook URL**. That custom webhook url will be **https://hub.spiff.com.au/neto/webhook/{integrationId}**. The integration id value is a unique value for your store. This value is to ensure that Spiff understands what store has hit the url on our side so that we can process the order correctly. After you have added in all details remember to press **Save changes**. **Image reference below.**
