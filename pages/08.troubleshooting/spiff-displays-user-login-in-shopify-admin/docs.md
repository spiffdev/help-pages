When a user logs in to Spiff through their shopify admin panel on rare occasions you will be displayed with a usr login screen.

This shouldnt happen as the shopfiy store name (yourstore.myshopify.com) should always be the logged in user when you view spiff through the admin panel.

To Fix this issue, whilst you are on the login screen

1. Right click on the grey area of the spiff screen and a menu will open
2. Select Inspect from the menu 
3. On the right hand side of the screen select Applications 
4.
