## Setting up your first product from start to finish

### Assumptions 
- You have already installed the [spiff plugin](https://apps.shopify.com/spiff-connect) on your Shopify store through the Shopify app store.
- You have your 3D models already setup to spiff [3D model Specifications](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/product-displays/3d-model-asset-request)
- You have any design assets ready for upload. E.g fonts, illustrations (SVG's) and images (PNG's and JPG's) 
- You have products already installed on your Shopify site. 

*** Note: If your store is live and you want to test without affecting live products set up a test theme by duplicating your live theme. Then re-name the copy of your live theme to spiff_yourstorename and install the snippet explained below on this theme and not on your live site. 

### Key Concepts 
Spiff Architecture - It doesnt matter in which order you start, but in order to get your first product up and running you need to have three things:
     - A product 
     - A worklfow
     - A 3D model  

Create your product

- Click on the create products button either on the home page in the spiff hub accessable through the app button in your shopify store. 
- Your products will begin to load from your shopify store. Depending on how many products you have in your store, this could take up to 1 minute. 
- Search for your product in the search bar at the top of the page.
- Select
