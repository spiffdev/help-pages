4. Make sure your png/jpg is not super large. Try to keep everything under 1mb otherwise things can load slowly.

5. Open your newly exported png/jpg in Illustrator and ensure it is the correct size you want it. When doing this make sure your point is set to the top left and your x and y is set to 0, 0. This needs to be on 0, 0 because our editor reads from the top left point.

6. Now you have your design in Illustrator you can draw a box around the areas you want to add text. This will be your [regions](https://help.spiff.com.au/spiff-concepts/workflows/step-details/regions). Select one of the boxes you have drawn and in the Properties tab you can see the measurements you will need to put in your region.
